\subsection{State Space Experiments}
The purpose of the state experiments are to show how \gls{bw} and our own algorithms and models perform in relation to the state space.
	\input{./content/Experiments/graphdata/state-result.tex}

Initial observations
\begin{itemize}
\item GE performs the best, except dataset 1. It seems like GE would surpass BW with a larger state space.
\item SBW performs worse than BW, note that dataset 41 has a fairly small y-axis, where the best GE result is about 800 points. We estimate an error margin of 100-200 points. Without more runs for each experiment, it is impossible to determine an exact error margin.
\item In general we seem to 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Transition Density Experiments}
The purpose of the transition density experiments are to show how \gls{bw} and our own algorithms and models perform in relation to the transition density.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Symbol Alphabet Size Experiments}
The purpose of the s are to show how \gls{bw} and our own algorithms and models perform in relation to the size of the emission symbol alphabet size.

Initial observations
\begin{itemize}
\item BW performs the best on 3 out of 4 sets
\item 
\item
