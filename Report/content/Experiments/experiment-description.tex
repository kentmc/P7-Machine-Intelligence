\subsection{Dataset Parameter Experiment}

The approach used for each dataset parameter experiment have been to cover a range of state amounts, ranging from 10 to 100 states alongside the previously defined parameters. \gls{bw} and \gls{sbw} were probed on specific state amounts with step sizes of 10, where the dynamic algorithms have been defined to reach either some local maxima or stop at 100 states.
