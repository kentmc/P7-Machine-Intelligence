\section{Dataset experiments}
The approach used for each dataset parameter experiment have been to cover a range of state amounts, ranging from 10 to 100 states, together with the previously define parameters. \gls{bw} was probed on specific state amounts with step sizes of 10, where the dynamic algorithms have been defined to reach either some local maxima or stop at 100 states.

\subsection{State Space Experiments}

The purpose of the state experiments are to show how \gls{bw} and our own algorithms and models perform in relation to different number of states.\\

In Figure \ref{fig:states} the ranges of log likelihood should be noted carefully. A large likelihood difference exist between the data sets, which can at least partly be explained by the observed sequences in the data sets. A higher complexity of the data sequences will naturally be harder to learn. For instance data set 41 seems to have a lower likelihood than data set 6. Looking into the sequences of these two data sets we find that data set 41 has an average sequence length of 7,3 characters, using 7 different symbols, whereas data set 6 has an average sequence length of 14,7 characters, using 6 different symbols. From these numbers it is clear that the amount of possible combinations is much lower for data set 41, compared to data set 6.




Initial observations
\begin{itemize}
\item GE performs the best, except dataset 1. It seems like GE would surpass BW with a larger state space.
\item SBW performs worse than BW, note that dataset 41 has a fairly small y-axis, where the best GE result is about 800 points. We estimate an error margin of 100-200 points. Without more runs for each experiment, it is impossible to determine an exact error margin.
\item In general we seem to
