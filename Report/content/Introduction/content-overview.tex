\section{Content Overview}
This chapter will introduce the project, lay down some guidelines for the focus of the project and present the problem definition.

In Chapter 2, the used theory is presented and described to give the reader knowledge necessary to understand the work done in the remaining chapters.

Chapter 3, describe the algorithms, and reasoning about what properties the algorithms developed in the project should implement. And hypothesis for how these algorithms would perform on the data is stated.

Chapter 4, describe the experiment set up, and how the dataset and rules of the experiments was chosen, and then puts the hypothesis to the test, and present the experiments to see how the algorithms performs on different datasets and compared to each other.

In Chapter 5, the result from all the experiments is shown. Tendencies and patterns in the results is analysed.

Chapter 6, conclude on the project and reflect on which project objectives was obtained, and what could be done different.

Chapter 7, reflects on what can be done as a next step if the project was continued and where to look in order to perform better in the experiments.
