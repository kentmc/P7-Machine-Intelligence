\section{Content Overview}
This chapter will introduce the project, lay down some guidelines for the focus of the project and present the problem definition.

In Chapter 2, the used theory is presented and described to give the reader knowledge necessary to understand the work done in the remaining chapters.

Chapter 3, provides description of the algorithms, and reasoning about what properties should be considered key and thus implemented in the algorithms introduced in the project. Hypothesis for how these algorithms should perform on the data is also stated.

Chapter 4, describes the experiment set up, and how the dataset and rules of the experiments were chosen. Next the hypothesis is put to the test and presents experiments to see how the algorithms performs on different datasets and compare to each other.

In Chapter 5, the result from all the experiments is shown. Tendencies and patterns in the results are analysed.

Chapter 6, concludes on the project and reflects on which project objectives were achieved, and what could have been done differently to obtain better results.

Chapter 7, reflects on what can be done as the next step and where to look in order to perform better in the experiments.
