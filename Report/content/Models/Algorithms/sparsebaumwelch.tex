\subsection{Sparse Baum-Welch}
This algorithm creates a \gls{hmm} $M$ with $n$ states and $s$ symbols.
All parameters are initialized randomly but with the constraint that each state has exactly $\lceil log(n) \rceil$ outgoing transitions.
Which transitions to discard are chosen randomly before training with \gls{baum-welch} either by $BW_t(M, D)$ or $BW^i(M, D)$.
