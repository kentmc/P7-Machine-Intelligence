\subsubsection{Sparse Baum Welch}
This algorithm creates a \gls{hmm} $M$ with $n$ states and $s$ symbols.
All parameters are initialized randomly but with the constraint that each state has exactly $\lceil log(n) \rceil$ outgoing transitions.
Which transitions to discard are chosen randomly.
Return $BW_t(M, D)$ or $BW^i(M, D)$, depending on what is requested.
