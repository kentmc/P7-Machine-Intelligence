\subsection{Sparse Baum-Welch}
This algorithm creates a \gls{hmm} $M$ with $n$ states and $m$ symbols.
All parameters are initialized randomly but with the constraint that each state has exactly $\lceil log(n) \rceil$ outgoing transitions. The probabilities of other transitions are set to zero.
Transitions set to non-zero probabilities are chosen randomly before training with the \gls{baum-welch} until convergence to a specified threshold $t$.
