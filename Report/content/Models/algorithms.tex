\section{Algorithms}
In this section a number of algorithms are described, which all try to learn the parameters of a \gls{hmm} given a set of training sequences $D$, which contains a number of sequences over $s$ distinct symbols.
In other words, each algorithm will try to find a model that makes the generation of the particular training sequences most likely.
Since a \gls{hmm} can be represented by the use of either matrices or a graph-like structure, any of the algorithms may output either a matrix or a graph representation of a \gls{hmm}, denoted by $M$ or $G$ respectively.
By $LL(M)$ or $LL(G)$ we denote the logarithmic likelihood of the training sequences given the model.

The algorithms proposed in this section have been divided into two types.
The static algorithms start with a \gls{hmm} with a particular number of states which will never change.
The dynamic algorithms start with a small \gls{hmm} in regards to the number of states, and will dynamically extend the number of states through a number of iterations. 
For the static algorithms, $n$ denotes the number of states to be used.
For the dynamic algorithms, $n$ denotes a number of iterations $1, ..., n$, where each iteration extends the model by a single node.
In \ref{fig:alg-hierarchy} the names and classes of our proposed algorithms can be seen. Note that the \gls{baum-welch} has also been included, simply to emphasize which class of algorithms it belongs to.

Since the \gls{baum-welch} is guaranteed to never worsen $LL(G)$ when run on $G$, it is used internally by some of the algorithms.
By $BW_t(M, D)$ we denote the \gls{hmm} obtained after running Baum Welch on the \gls{hmm} $M$ using the training sequences $D$, and iterating as long as each iteration increases the likelihood by at least $t$.
By $BW^i(M, D)$ we denote the \gls{hmm} obtained after running $i$ iterations of Baum Welch on the \gls{hmm} $M$ using the training sequences $D$.
If a \gls{hmm} is represented by a graph, we denote it $G$, and the similar notations $BW_t(G, D)$ and $BW^i(G, D)$ are used.
