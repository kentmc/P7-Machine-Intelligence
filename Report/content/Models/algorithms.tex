\section{Algorithms}
In this section several algorithms are proposed, which all try to learn the parameters of a \gls{hmm} given a set of training sequences $D$, which contains a number of sequences over $m$ distinct symbols.
In other words, each algorithm will try to find a model that makes the generation of the particular training sequences most likely.
Since a \gls{hmm} can be represented by the use of either matrices or a graph-like structure, the algorithms may refer to an \gls{hmm} using matrix or graph terms interchangeably. 

The algorithms proposed have been divided into two types.
The static algorithms start with a \gls{hmm} with a particular number of states which will never change.
The dynamic algorithms start with a small \gls{hmm} in regards to the number of states, and will dynamically extend the number of states through a number of iterations. 
For the static algorithms, $n$ denotes the number of states to be used.
In \ref{fig:alg-hierarchy} the names and classes of our proposed algorithms can be seen. Note that the \gls{baum-welch} has also been included, simply to emphasize which class of algorithms it belongs to.
